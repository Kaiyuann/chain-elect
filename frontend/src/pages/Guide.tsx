            <h3 className="mt-4">4Ô∏è‚É£ Privacy & Security</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Votes are sent directly to the blockchain ‚Äî <strong>not through the backend</strong>.</li>
                <li>The backend cannot link your account to your vote.</li>
                <li>Tokens are hashed and stored on the blockchain; once used, a token cannot be reused.</li>
                <li>The system ensures <strong>one vote per token</strong>, maintaining fairness and privacy.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>‚ùì What happens if I lose my voting token?</strong>
                    <p>Your voting token is a one-time code that cannot be reissued. If you lose it before voting, you will not be able to participate in that poll. Please make sure to keep the token safe after requesting it.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>‚ùì Can I request more than one voting token for the same poll?</strong>
                    <p>No. Each user can only request one token per poll. The backend tracks token requests and prevents multiple token generation for the same poll by the same account.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>‚ùì Can the poll creator or the backend administrator see how I voted?</strong>
                    <p>No. Your vote is sent directly to the blockchain from your browser, not through the backend. The token is hashed on-chain, and the vote choice is not stored alongside any identifiable information.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>‚ùì What if someone shares their voting token with others?</strong>
                    <p>The system cannot stop someone from sharing their token, but each token can only be used once. After a token is used, it becomes invalid for future voting attempts.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>‚ùì Can I change my vote after submitting it?</strong>
                    <p>No. Once a vote is submitted to the blockchain, it cannot be altered or removed. Please double-check your selection before submitting.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>‚ùì Why do I need a token to vote? Why not just use my account?</strong>
                    <p>The token system ensures that your vote remains anonymous. Using accounts directly could link your identity to your vote, but tokens allow participation without exposing your chosen option.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
